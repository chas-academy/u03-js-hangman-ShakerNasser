# Task - Hangman 

This task involves individually implementing a popular rudimentary game in JavaScript - "Hangman". There will be code and a structure available to use as a reference while solving the task.

Hangman is a game where a word is randomly chosen. The player then guesses which letters the word contains, and for each incorrect guess, a part of the "hangman" image is drawn. If the player guesses wrong enough times and the hangman has been "hanged", the player loses. However, if the player manages to guess all the letters, they win.

# Requirements:

A functioning game in JavaScript that can be played on a website.
Works in various browsers and on different devices (mobile and desktop).
Basic responsiveness.
Buttons for all letters.
Visual representation of the hangman (game progression).

## The code should:

Follow defined standards.
Have correct indentation.
Not cause errors when executed.
Be extensively commented (in code, markup, and style).
